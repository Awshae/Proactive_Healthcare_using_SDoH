1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:

Populate Raw Data:
Run the services/data_ingestion.py functions to fetch real-time SDOH data from your chosen sources (APIs, CSVs, databases).
Save the raw data into the data/raw/ directory.
Process Data:
Create a script (e.g., process_data.py) that utilizes services/feature_engineering.py to:
Load the raw data.
Clean and transform the data.
Create lag, rolling window, and time features.
Save the processed data to the data/processed/ directory.
2. Model Training and Evaluation:

Train the Model:
Create a script (e.g., train.py) that uses models/training.py to:
Load the processed data.
Define the features and target variable.
Scale the data.
Train the LSTM model.
Save the trained model to models/trained_model.pkl.
Evaluate the Model:
Create a script (e.g., evaluate.py) that uses models/evaluation.py to:
Load the processed data and the trained model.
Calculate and print the evaluation metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE).
3. API Development:

Implement API Routes:
In api/routes.py, define the API endpoints for:
Fetching forecasts for a given location or time period.
Retrieving risk scores for specific communities.
Potentially, updating data or retraining the model (with proper security).
Set Up the Flask Application:
In api/app.py, create the Flask application, register the API routes, and configure security settings.
Include error handling, and input validation.
Implement security:
Use the security.py file to encrypt, decrypt, and hash data.
Use access control to only allow authorized users access to the api.
4. Risk Assessment and Forecasting:

Implement Forecasting Logic:
Create a script or integrate into the API that uses services/risk_assessment.py to:
Load the trained model.
Generate forecasts for future time steps.
Calculate risk scores based on the forecasts.
5. Testing:

Unit Tests:
Write unit tests in the tests/ directory using unittest or pytest to verify the functionality of individual modules (e.g., test_forecasting.py, test_data_ingestion.py).
Integration Tests:
Write integration tests to verify the interaction between different modules (e.g., API endpoints, data processing pipeline).
6. Deployment:

Dockerization:
Build a Docker image using the Dockerfile to package your application and its dependencies.
Use docker-compose.yml to define and manage the application's services (e.g., API, database).
Cloud Deployment:
Deploy the Docker containers to a cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
Configure a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) for load balancing and security.
Ensure that the cloud infrastructure is HIPAA compliant.
Environment Variables:
Use the .env file to store sensitive data, and configuration parameters.
Never hard code sensitive information into the code.
7. Monitoring and Maintenance:

Logging:
Use the centralized logging system (utils/logger.py) to monitor the application's performance and identify errors.
Monitoring Tools:
Set up monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track key metrics (e.g., API response times, resource utilization).
Model Retraining:
Implement a process for periodically retraining the model with new data to maintain its accuracy.
Data Updates:
Create a system that automatically updates the data from the different sources.
8. Web Interface:

Create a web interface that can display the results of the api.
Create map visualizations of risk areas.
Create dashboards that display the health care demand forecasts.
Create a system that allows healthcare providers to adjust staffing or supplies.
Create a system that allows healthcare providers to contact social services.
Key Considerations:

Scalability: Design the system to handle increasing data volumes and user traffic.
Reliability: Implement error handling and redundancy to ensure high availability.
Security: Adhere to HIPAA compliance and best practices for data security.
Maintainability: Write clean, well-documented code and use a modular architecture.
